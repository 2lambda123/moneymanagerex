    <h2>Stocks, Shares and Share Dividend Management in MMEX</h2>
    <p>
        The terms <strong>Stocks</strong> and <strong>Shares</strong> generally mean the
        same thing but depending on how we use these terms, could mean something
        different.
        Here we refer to Stocks as companies, and Shares as units of value within the
        company. Generally we would obtain Stocks via a Stock Broker and purchase or
        sell shares in the company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initializing Stocks and Shares is initially a two stage process.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>First we create the Stock Entry and the associated Share Account.</li>
        <li>We add the initial Shares information to our Share Account.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Any subsequent transactions involving Share movements is accessed via the
        company in the Stock Portfolio view.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any transaction associated with our normal accounts is done via the Account View using the associated Shares
        Account.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating a Stock Portfolio for our Stocks</h3>
    <p>
        In order to use Stocks and Shares in MMEX, we need to create an account of type: <strong>Investment</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The name
        for this account would generally be the name of the Stock Broker. In our example
        we have selected the stock broker being called: <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This account would appear in the navigation tree under the heading <strong>Stock Portfolios. </strong>&nbsp;When
        we expand the <strong>Stock Portfolios</strong> branch in the navigation
        tree, we would see our newly created Stock Portfolio account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selecting our new
        account Yahoo Finance opens the view: <strong>Stock Portfolio: Yahoo Finance.</strong>&nbsp;
        In this view we can now add the stocks that we own.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding Stocks to our Stock Portfolio</h3>
    <p>
        We refer to Stocks as the companies that we have purchased shares.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us say that we purchase shares in two companies from out stock broker <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>,
        we would create new entries in the stock portfolio view for our
        companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>As an initial entry for each company we would supply the following</strong>:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Company Name</strong><br />
            Example: Alpha Corporation<br />
            This will also allow us to create a Share Account for this company of the same
            name.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stock Symbol</strong><br />
            Example: APC.AX<br />
            [ APC ] being the Stock Exchange code,&nbsp;&nbsp; [ .AX ] being the Stock
            Exchange to obtain current share value information
        </li>
        <li>
            <span><b>Share Number</b> being the initial number of shares</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Share Price</b><br />
            This is the cost per share
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Commission</strong><br />
            This is generally the remaining value for incomplete shares<br />
            Example: Purchase of $1000.00 worth of shares at $2.35 per share, gives us 425
            shares and $1.25 as commission.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong><br />
        The fields <strong>Date</strong>, <strong>Share Number</strong>,
        <strong>Share Price</strong> and <strong>Commission</strong> are duplicated
        for each share transaction that we enter.
        <br />
        The Date in the Stock Portfolio view becomes obsolete,
        and it is recommended that this field is hidden.
    </p>

    <p>New Stock Investment example:</p>
            <p><img class="shadow" alt='stock_shares_new_stock' src='../en/stock_shares_new_stock.png'></p>

    <aside class="sticky notes">
        <header>Note</header>
            Important: Save before close to keep any changes
    </aside>

    <p>
        saving this entry, the Share Account and Share Linkage can be set up.<br />
        Subsequent use of this dialog allows us to update the share price for this stock.
        When aditional shares have been purchased, this price will affect all shares.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding Initial Shares to our Stock</h3>
    <p>
        Now that we have created the initial Stock entry, we need to Add a Transaction
        to our Stock to create the initial Shares entry.
        The initial share information
        is transferred to our new share transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we would add extra information similar to a normal transaction.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Account<br />
            This would be the associated Share Account created when the Stock was initially
            created. If this was not done, any other account can be used for this
            transaction.<br />
            In order to keep track of transactions, it is recommended that a
            Share Account is created.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Type</strong> - Deposit or Withdrawal - Transfer<br />
            Withdrawal from the share account represents a deposit to the actual shares<br />
            Deposit from the share account represents a withdrawal to the actual shares
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer<br />
            All Share transactions are in effect transfers to and from actual share
            investments depending on the transaction being a purchase or sale of shares.
            <br />
            If the transaction is required to be accounted as an expense or as income, we
            would then remove the transfer selection.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Addition of Shares to our transaction</p>
    <img class="shadow" alt='stock_shares_new_shares' src='../en/stock_shares_new_shares.png'>

    <h3>Adding Subsequent Share Entries to our Stock</h3>
    <p>
        Purchase or sale of shares is achieved by accessing the stock entry in the Stock
        Portfolio view and adding new transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we need to add the share information and control the purchase or sale via
        the transaction section of the share entry:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Share Purchase</span><br />
            <span>Transaction type is <b>Withdrawal</b></span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Share Sale</span><br />
            <span>Transaction type is <strong>Deposit</strong></span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stock Portfolio Account</h2>
    <p>
        <span>
            Our Stock Portfolio Account
            now displays a summary of the Stocks we have.
        </span>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>The stock broker name is used to define the Stock Investment name.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                The
                companies we buy shares from become the share name
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Shares are generally associated with a Share
                Account having the same name as the company name.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                The Shares Accounts heading can be seen by using the menu item:
                <strong>View</strong> ---&gt; <strong>Display Share Accounts</strong>
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Example:<br />
        Companies Alpha Corp and Beta Corp maintain their accounts with Yahoo
        Finance.<br />
        Here we have hidden various headings as these become meaningless in this view.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note:<br />
        Initial share price is not listed in this view.<br />
        This is because the share price becomes meaningless in a summary
        view as each purchase will generally have a different share price.
    </p>

    <h2>Stock Transaction List View</h2>

    <p>When we have added shares to our account we can see the associated
        share transactions using the View Transactions</p>

    <h2>Share Accounts in MMEX</h2>

    <p>
        A Share account contain the transactions that are associated with this company stock.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially we would set aside money for investment in Stocks and
        Shares. This is achieved by transferring money from our general
        accounts to a Share account.
    </p>
    <p>
        As shares are purchased and dividends received, we can now keep track
        of our investment over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a transactions, we can also use the company name as a Payee. It is
        also advisable to create categories of:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Share: Purchase</li>
        <li>Share: Dividend</li>
        <li>Share: Sale</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Adding Dividends to our Shares</h2>
    <p>
        Accessing our share account, we can add ordinary transactions to our
        shares account.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A share dividend transaction becomes a normal transaction.</li>
        <li>The same rules for Income and Expense apply to share accounts
            when a transaction is created in the Account View.</li>
        <li>Actual commissions paid to a stock broker should also
            be recorded as a separate transaction.</li>
    </ol>
